# NvivoR
NvivoR series of small functions I have developed to import data from Nvivo to R. The workflow is currently NVivo -> Word -> R as I couldn't acces the text in codes in any other way. The functions are experimental at the moment and fit only highly specefic purpose. However, my aim is to experiment with this further, package it as a GitHub R package, and generalise the functions further.
